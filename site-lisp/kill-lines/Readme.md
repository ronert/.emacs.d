kill-lines.el is an Emacs packages that makes it easy to kill multiple consecutive lines. When kill-lines is run, it turns on line numbers and highlights the current line (if they aren't already turned on), prompts for a line number, then kills from the current line to the given lines, turning off line numbers and current line highlighting (if they weren't already on).

You can bind kill-lines to a key binding. I use C-c C-k.
